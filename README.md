- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mellifera77, nice to meet you all
- 👀 I’m interested in front end development, digital marketing, and e-commerce
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything for me personally, but can use practice with oversight, so will gladly accept invitations to help others. A mentor would be nice.
- 📫 How to reach me...I hope you can message me in GitHub. I'm new so don't know all the features yet. Otherwise, I'm the only Melissa J Farrow on Facebook
